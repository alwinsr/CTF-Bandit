#Level 0  - logging into bandit, using the specific port and username

ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220 -l bandit0

#Currently bandit0 has an error where it will not accept the password on first try
#Solution to password failing is to on purpose write a wrong password 
#(I wrote "bandit()" then on second request type in the right password "bandit0"

bandit()
bandit0

#Level 1- look in commands typing ls

ls

#home directory has a readme file. to read the file type "cat readme"

cat readme

#a code is given " boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1 ", save code for next part of level

#only a dash is showing up so lets see if we can read the dash

cat -

#cat and just a dash does not work. Lets try to find the exact file that - is holding

#Next we will use the password given to us " CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9 "

CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9

#Next we got to find the directory that holds the next password. 
#Clue is "spaces in this filename" the "cat < spaces in this filename" will not work but typing in "cat spa " 
#then pressing the Tab button will work to find this folder within folders file 
#because spaces is probably the only file that starts out with that exact name

cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename

#Using ls can lead to finding "inhere" file, but "cat inhere" does not work in showing what is inside. 
#Need to find the hidden file. 
#we can do that by ls. then a file called inhere will show.

#we now find out gzip is how data.txt/honeybee.bin was compressed into a hexdump
#we now need to find a way to decompress a gzip file
#this method will use zcat and bcat to decompress
#zcat will start off compressing and now we will
#set up a way for " file - " to be linked to read honeybee.bin

#originally done to data.txt/honeybee.bin's hexdump
#using " | " to keep linking more outputs for bzcat decompressions

#The output gives us a tar extension of the file locations compression
#for multiple files that are more than 2 to be stored for extraction.
#we will use tar and whatever other extensions zcat gives
#so we can continue to decompress
#we are going to put x0 for the number of times tar has been outputted
#since we only see tar once, we will extract x0

zcat honeybee.bin | bzcat | zcat | tar xO | tar xO | bzcat | tar xO | zcat | file -

# we now see something called " ASCII text "
#since we see text that must mean 
#we have reached the honeybee.bin/data.txt to a readable file
#we will now take out " | file - " so we can decompress this chaining

#now let's log into bandit 27 with the password
#heh. there is no lvl 27
#but if you stick around in bandit26 and type :shell
#you will eventually find the real bandit26 insides and there is a readme
#the read me congratulates you and says

#Congratulations on solving the last level of this game!

#At this moment, there are no more levels to play in this game. However, we #are constantly working
#on new levels and will most likely expand this game with more levels soon.
#Keep an eye out for an announcement on our usual communication channels!
#In the meantime, you could play some of our other wargames.

#If you have an idea for an awesome new level, please let us know!

#That's it! We are finished!

#A final note on bandit26
#if you have the password and the ssh, AND shrink the terminal size
#you can easily log in with 
#' ssh -i ./bandit26.sshkey bandit26@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220 '
# pw: 5czgV9L3Xx8JPOyRbXh6lQbmIOWvPT6Z
#and not have to do anything extra to get easier access to the vim
#after pressing " v "
#they may fix this in the future but this is the easiest way
#to access bandit26
```
